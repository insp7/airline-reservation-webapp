Airlines Reservation System
---------------------------

# Functionalities:

1. User registration & Authentication.
2. User can search for flights.
3. User can check for the availability of tickets of a flight, flight schedule.
4. User can book a ticket for a particular flight of any class. (receipt generated)
5. User can see details for the booked flight by entering booking number/Passenger name record(PNR, which is a code of 6 alphanumeric characters)
6. User can cancel booked ticket for a particular flight before 3 hours from the departure of flight.
7. After cancellation of a ticket, system also calculates the amount to be return to the user after deductions.
8. Admin can add or delete a flight.
9. Logging for each issuance/cancellation of tickets should be made in the system.
10. Payment.

# Database design:

users(id, first_name, last_name, email, password, gender, date_of_birth, contact_no, is_admin, created_at, updated_at);
airport(code, name, city, state);
flights(flight_no, source, destination, departure_date, arrival_date, capacity, created_at, updated_at, is_deleted);
fares(source, destination, cabin_class, passenger_type, fare); NOTE: passenger_types => [I: 'Infant', C: 'Child', A: 'Adult']
reservations(pnr, user_id, flight_no, cabin_class, total_fare, created_at, is_cancelled); 
passengers(pnr, seat_no, first_name, last_name, gender, date_of_birth, passenger_type); NOTE: add validation check for date_of_birth
booked_seats(flight_no, seat_no);

# DOUBTS: 

1. meaning of title attribute? (Removed title attribute as of now)
2. can there exist more than one admin (assuming one admin for now)
3. is passenger capacity constant(60) for every flight ? (assuming 60 capacity)

# NOTES:

1. Removed 'return_date' column from flights relation, because that functionality can be implemented on service layer.
2. Added 'passengers_count' in reservations relation.

# DERIVED ATTRIBUTES:

1. total_passengers_count(not stored in DB, since coming from passengers table for same pnr)
2. total_fare(stored in DB, even tho can be calculated using joins)
