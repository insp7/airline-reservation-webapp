# Database design:

users(id, title, first_name, last_name, email, password, date_of_birth, contact_no, is_admin, created_at, updated_at);
flights(flight_number, source, destination, departure_date, estimated_time_of_arrival, return_date, passenger_capacity, cabins_available, fare, created_at, updated_at, is_deleted);
reservations(pnr, user_id, flight_number, cabin_class, created_at, is_cancelled); 
seats(id, pnr, seat_number)


# DOUBTS: 

1. meaning of title attribute? 
2. can there exist more than one admin (assuming one admin for now)
3. is passenger capacity constant(60) for every flight ? (assuming 60 capacity)
